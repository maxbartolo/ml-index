    "In the context of Machine Learning, it is convenient to think of a tensor as an $n$-dimensional array. Tensor dimensionality is also commonly referred to as its *order*, *degree* or *rank*, which formally is the sum of the tensor contravariant and covariant indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalars are $0$-th order tensors. Vectors can be represented as $1$-dimensional arrays and are therefore $1$st-order tensors. In a fixed basis, a standard linear map that maps a vector to a vector, is represented by a matrix (a $2$-dimensional array) and is therefore a $2$nd-order tensor. Note that not all multidimensional arrays are necessarily a representation of a tensor (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor#Holors\" target=\"_blank\">*holors*</a>).\n",
